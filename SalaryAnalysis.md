# Analysis of Salaries Across UNC System Schools
As a student who is majoring in both Computer Science and Studio Art, I have noticed differences in the way the departments are funded. I will analyze the disparity in university funding across departments primarily sourcing data from the [UNC System's salary database](https://uncdm.northcarolina.edu/salaries/index.php). 

This project will investigate where University funding comes from and ways it is distributed.

According to [The Well](https://www.unc.edu/discover/carolinas-money-where-we-get-it-how-we-spend-it/#:~:text=The%20University%20gets%20its%20funding,housing%2C%20dining%20and%20other%20services.) "the University gets its funding from a variety of places: research grants, tuition and fees, state appropriations, gifts, investment returns and income generated through housing, dining and other services." UNC spends over $3 billion in a year, and these various funding sources are used to pay salaries across departments within the university.
